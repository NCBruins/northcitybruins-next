2. Find the text you want to change
3. Edit and save
4. Refresh your browser to see changes

### Modify Colors
Your team colors are already applied! But if you want to tweak:
1. Open `/css/style.css`
2. Search for:
   - `#003366` (navy blue)
   - `#FFD026` (gold)
3. Replace with your preferred colors

### Add Social Media Links
Update the footer social links in each HTML file:
```html
<a href="YOUR_FACEBOOK_URL" class="facebook">&nbsp;</a>
<a href="YOUR_TWITTER_URL" class="twitter">&nbsp;</a>
<a href="YOUR_INSTAGRAM_URL" class="googleplus">&nbsp;</a>
```
